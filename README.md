A compiler that compiles JS to C++

Should lead to very portable native code written in JS.

Performance should benefit greatly even without special optimizations

Far-Future: Use html, css, and js as your front-end in a native window. A neat GUI app idea I have. I will emulate JS interface to the DOM. Hopefully there is a good library I can make my API out of. GUI apps with this framework will link that and off they go. No more X11 and Win32, etc.

JS is soooo good I think it should be the only language we really need to use, unless you have to write something really low level, idk.

Why work in C++ for native projects when you can get the ease of use of JS/Html/CSS with the same performance? As JavaScript becomes better and better I think this kind of environment will dominate.

Great Book about writing compilers! "The Dragon Book." Kanye is pleased.
